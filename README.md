# Affine Transformation of an Image
This code performs affine transformations (rotation, translation, scaling, and shear) on an input image using MATLAB's built-in functions.

# Getting Started
To use this code, you will need to have MATLAB installed on your computer.

# Prerequisites
You should have some basic knowledge of MATLAB programming language and image processing.

# Usage
- Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
- Open MATLAB and navigate to the downloaded directory.
- Open the MATLAB script file affine_transform.m.
- Modify the values of the transformation parameters (theta, tx, ty, Sx, Sy, shx, and shy) as per your requirements.
- Run the script to apply the transformations on the input image.
- The transformed images will be displayed in separate figures.

# Parameters
- theta: rotation angle in degrees
- tx: translation in x direction
- ty: translation in y direction
- Sx: scaling factor in x direction
- Sy: scaling factor in y direction
- shx: horizontal shear factor
- shy: vertical shear factor
- Built With
- MATLAB R2021a
- MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox
